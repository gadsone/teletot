Take a look at app tutorial at https://vimeo.com/320338340

### Our mission: Helping new parents adjust to parenthood one tip at a time. 
Introduction to the iPhone app:
Raising children nowadays can be very difficult for parents. We have created an application called, TeleTot is which is  designed for new parents of the millennial generation. Our application will allow for parents to connect with other parents in their communities. As society increases their dependency on cell phones, as a team we designed a platform where parents can be able to turn for dependable advice on day to day bumps they might face while raising their beloved tots.

### Features of this app:
To enhance our application we decided to incorporate different features to assist parents. Some of the features are a medical advice, events calendar, chat forum, a live chat, videos, trade in, frequently asked questions and coupons.  Our Medical advice feature will expose parents to certified professionals in their community and provide advice to better serve their children. While keeping this feature in mind we will have a disclaimer on our app notifying parents to take the advice at their own risk. This medical advice feature will allow users to find doctors near them and also allow them to schedule an appointment if they would like.  Once the user selects a doctor of their choice they will be able to view the doctor’s avatar, age, sex, availability, and their address along with other bio information.  We have also included a review feature which gives the user the access to view the professionals ratings as well as rate them themselves. TeleTot will also have a special feature called trade in, where parents can purchase cost effective goods which are highly recommended. We also have a calendar event that will  which will display events that are happening throughout the community, such as toy drives, fundraising for children, play events, library events, and community gatherings. We will have a section set up for advertisements and coupons. This gives parents savings on essentials needed to support their children. TeleTot  Will have a live chat where parents and other community members can collectively come together and discuss and share information needed to help one another in being a successful parent. Lastly, we will include a general advice session open to anyone that would like to provide advice on raising a child.

### Stakeholders:

Our application will be available in the Apple store and the Google Play store. In order to download the application on a smartphone or a tablet, parents will download  the application “TeleTot” , which will be free.  We decided to have  a free application because it will get more users. 
We plan on generating income through the advertisements, coupons, and videos sponsored by different organizations.  After our stakeholder analysis, profit is expected to generate in less than a month because it does not take much funding to create this app. 
Scope and scale: 
Developing the app:

There are multiple step when it comes to designing an application. Here are the steps:  
-	Step 1: You must first download XCode or android studio on your hand held device. XCode is a development platform for iPhones which is available at no cost from the Apple store and android studio can be downloaded from the Google Play. 
-	Step 2: Install a text editor. You can either download  TextMate or JEdit. 
-	Step 3: The next step is to install a vector graphics program in order to create art and designs for our application. We will also need to download a vector programs. Some vector programs include CorelDraw, Adobe Illustrator, and Inkscape.

### Stated rationale (Scope and Scale):

The organizations that will be included in the app directly reflect our mission and our audience (the users). According to PewResearch.org, “1.2 million millennial women gave birth for the first time in 2016” .  Knowing our target users, organizations like The Program for Early Parent Support (PEPS), will connect parents in the same peer group. They specifically target first-time parents and match them with a community of their peers through special programs. Also, the National Diaper Bank Network (NDBN) is extremely important since new mothers use about 165 diapers per month.   Diapers can be expensive, so letting our new parents know of the resources out their that could reduce cost is extremely crucial to our success. Moreover, the National Parenting Education Network (NPEN) will provide a network for new parents looking to learn about the development and well-being of their kids. Adding this to our app will ensure that our users are well-equipped with meeting the demands of parenthood. 

Looking at different causes, our app wants to promote and bring awareness to child welfare and financial stability in families. We recognize that making sure a new child is being provided for is the main concern with new parents. New parents worry if they are caring for their child correctly or if they can support them financially. As we expand, TeleTot wants to ease the mind of new parents by being well-informed and aware on the issues of their environment. 

With regards to events mentioned in our app, Baby Expo and the parent conventions (MommyCon and DaddyCon) will allow new parents to meet organizations and programs willing to aid them in their new lifestyle. 

Since we want to provide the best experience for new families, any organizations (PTA), events, and/or causes that do not directly relate to 
TeleTot’s mission should will not be included in our app. We are solely focused on making sure new parents adjust. 
About the Users:
Our main audience for this application are parents with young children  between the ages of 12 to 36 months in the United States. We hope to expand to other parts of the world in the near future.  We expect parents to refer to our application for references when seeking parental advice.The parent will be able to communicate with other parents and community members.  Having easy access to TeleTot makes for a likeable information resource for millenials and the world’s busiest parents trying to balance it all.

### Metadata Lifespan:
Our app will have different varieties of resources that will help guide parents in raising their children. If a individual is a first time parent, it tends to be overwhelming for them. Children who are between the age of 12 to 36 months can not communicate via words  with their parents. One of our resources will have a toddler behavior selection where a list of feelings and actions that toddlers go through during the age of 12-36 months. Our applications will provide links to videos to help parents ease up on the situation that they are struggling with because every child is different. It takes patience and time to work with young children.
